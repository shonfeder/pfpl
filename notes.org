** TODO On judgments and deductions
Taking a quasi-kantian perspective (which is not inappropriate, given the kantian
tendencies of Martin-LÃ¶f's project): the ABTs introduced in Chapter 1 are
the spacial manifolds of intuition: they give the condition of possibility for
the simultaneous appearance of representations (atomic terms). The selection of evaluation
system (transition systems here), are a selection of the temporal manifold: they
give the condition of possibility for the sequential appearance of
representations.

These together set out the content of our cognitions about programming
languages.

Chapters 2 and 3 set out the core logic, i.e., the way concepts are formed.
* Tasks
*** DONE Add mdx tests for e
*** TODO Theorem 6.1 - Type Safety for E
- [ ] Implement PBTs for type both properties.
*** TODO Inference as ABT
*** TODO Deduction defined on top of this syntax
It's the evaluation strategy?
